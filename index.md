### Functional programming? 

--

## `input -> f() -> output -> g() -> output`

--

## `input -> f() -> output -> g() -> output`

## `=> input -> f(g()) -> output`

### State of the world 

> "An interactive program is a pure function that takes the current 'state of the world' as its argument and produces a modified world as result"

### State of the world 

> "An interactive program is a pure function that takes the current 'state of the world' as its argument and produces a modified world as result"

> "Don't try to track real world state in your code.instead take it's argument, since only the world knows what state it's In."

### Square each element in the array

### Square each element in the array

OOP way

```php
$array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; //-> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

for($i = 0; $i < count($array); $i++) {
	$array[$i] = pow($array[$i], 2);
}

$array; //-> [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

--

### Square each element in the array

FP way

```php
$array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; //-> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

$square = function (int $num): int {
	return pow($num, 2);
};

array_map($square, $array);  //-> [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

### Sum of elements in array

OOP way

```php
$sum = 0;

for($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
   $sum += $i;
}

// $sum -> 55
```

### Sum of elements in array

FP way

```php
array_sum(range(1, 10)); //-> 55
```
